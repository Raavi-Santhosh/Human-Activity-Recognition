# HumanActivityRecognition

This project is to build a model that predicts the human activities such as Walking, Walking_Upstairs, Walking_Downstairs, Sitting, Standing or Laying.

This dataset is collected from 30 persons(referred as subjects in this dataset), performing different activities with a smartphone to their waists. The data is recorded with the help of sensors (accelerometer and Gyroscope) in that smartphone. This experiment was video recorded to label the data manually.

1. 96% of accuracy using SVM when trained on 561 engineered features from 9 timeseries data in the dtaa set

2. Deployed in Azure and Amazon EC2 platforms
